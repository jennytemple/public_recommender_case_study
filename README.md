## Summary: Built a Ranking Factorization Recommender model. 

Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and GraphLab, built a Ranking Factorization Recommender model, incorporating side features, 
to recommend jokes to users. Parameters for the model were tuned, and the model choices were compared by using the precision_recall metric. The goal of the model was to recommend the top jokes for users, so the precision_recall metric was the most appropriate for evaluating the models with respect to the goals.
